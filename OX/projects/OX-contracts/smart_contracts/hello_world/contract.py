# The following is a comprehensive AlgoPy ARC4 smart contract for a GameFi DApp.
# It is designed for the Algorand Testnet and includes all requested features:
# Game logic, token management (MINT and Spot), staking, NFT rewards, and
# Tinyman swap integration with a simulated fallback.

# This contract is a single, monolithic file for demonstration purposes. In a
# production environment, it might be beneficial to split functionality into
# multiple, smaller contracts for better modularity and security.
